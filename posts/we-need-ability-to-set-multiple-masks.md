We need the ability to be able to set multiple masks on the fly.

If you do:

mc1.setMask(myMask);

and then you add mc2.setMask(myMask);

mc1 gets unmasked, of course we can put mc1 and mc2 into one mc and create mc3 then we can mask mc3 as follows

mc3.setMask(myMask);

But I don't want to do it that way, period :)

Now since we are talking about masks, how about allowing us to fade masks? Yes I know that we can't do that right now but hey! wouldn't it be nice if we could do that too?

myMask.\_alpha = 50;

Well, lets just hope that AS3 brings some of these goodies or maybe Flash9... or Flash10?
