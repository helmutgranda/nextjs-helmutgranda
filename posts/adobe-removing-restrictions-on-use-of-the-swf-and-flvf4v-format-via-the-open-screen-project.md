> The Open Screen Project is working to enable a consistent runtime environment â€“ taking advantage of AdobeÂ® FlashÂ® Player and, in the future, Adobe AIRâ„¢ -- that will remove barriers for developers and designers as they publish content and applications across desktops and consumer devices, including phones, mobile internet devices (MIDs), and set top boxes.
