Does getting ready to get things done get in the way of getting stuff done? Although this video emphasizes procrastination I would say that the person represented in the video was getting things done, but not the things that were supposed to get done.

Next time you start a new task ask yourself, Is this really going to help me accomplish my original goal?

Enjoy!
