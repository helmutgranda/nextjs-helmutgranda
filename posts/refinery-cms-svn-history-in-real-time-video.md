> We're very excited about that, and very grateful to the 70-plus contributors who've made it better and more powerful. In honor of you all, Phil Arndt created this [awesome video](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10962802/refinerycms-gource.mp4 "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10962802/refinerycms-gource.mp4") (thanks also to [Gource](http://code.google.com/p/gource/ "http://code.google.com/p/gource/")). It's 125 MB, so you've been warned. But it really is worth checking out.Â
