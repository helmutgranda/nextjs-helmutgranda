I just got back from attending my first ATF Saturday from Syracuse. There my life was changed forever. There I learned so much that I never understood and on Friday I rededicated my life to the Lord. Then on Saturday it was put on my heart to go on a missions trip and so I will this upcoming summer. I just think that it was definitely an expierience that I will never forget. I got to meet so many new friends and God changed my life forever. Thank you to everyone who made it possible! **\- Andrew Bruegger, NY** [acquirethefire](http://www.acquirethefire.com/)
