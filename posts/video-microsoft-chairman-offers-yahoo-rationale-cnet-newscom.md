Bill Gates offers some insight on their rationale behind trying to acquire Yahoo... and everyone is talking about that. What i found more interesting is their approach to provide their software for free to students. Now that is a move that I believe it is going to help them greatly. If you are a student you might not be able to afford $400+ USD software, even some professionals have a hard time gathering the cash to buy the software. Some packages cost as much as $2,000+ USD. So providing Microsoft products for free to students -I believe- it is the right move because those same kids that will spend hours using the software right now, tomorrow will shape the stability of what software is being used at that moment.

_In an interview with CNET News.com's Ina Fried, Microsoft's chairman explains why the company is giving away its developer tools to students and offers a glimpse at the rationale behind the Yahoo bid._ [Source](http://www.news.com/1606-2_3-6231197.html)
