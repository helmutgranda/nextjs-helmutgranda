My main Flash Player for testing content online is always the latest debugger version (in this case the current player is [flash 9](http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html)). For some odd reason it always crashes on random sites on PPC but Intel it works flawlessly. After many installing, uninstalling, reinstalling, installing again.. I figured I would give a try to the flash player 10 debugger version and so far so good.

So if your browse keeps on crashing with the flash player 9 debugger version, give flash player 10 a try:

Remember to treat this player as any other Beta software, in another words use with caution.
