One of the features that I would like to have as a default for TextMate is the ability to navigate through functions with the keyboard rather than having move back and forth between the keyboard and mouse or scroll line by line with the down/up keys.

Since the feature is not available (or at least not that I know of) I created 2 simple macros that would allow you to jump to the Next or Previous function. Those macros are tied up to the keys as follows:

Next Function: Shift+Apple+Down

Previous Function Shift+Apple+Up

[You can download the macros here](http://www.helmutgranda.com/labs/textmate/HelmutGrandaBundle.zip)

_Please note that as default the key combinations noted above select all the text from the marker position. It is something that I rarely use so I was able to trade that in for the navigation ability._
