I have for a long time toyed with the idea of moving my content to something like Gatsby. Although I tried to do so by exporting all the content to markdown, I wanted to continue using the capabilities that WordPress CMS offers, so with that in mind, this is the process of moving what is almost 20 years worth of content into Gatsby going Headless, granted I do not have thousands of posts to move, but it still seems like a great opportunity to explore the possibilities.
