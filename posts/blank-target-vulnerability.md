A developer that opens a new window or tab with `target=‘_blank’` is exposing their users to a little known vulnerability which deals with a malicious code taking ownership of the new opened window.

This can be easily solved by appending `rel=“noopener noreferrer”` to the anchor tags. With that said the URLs should look like this:

```
<a href="newpage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Page</a>
```
