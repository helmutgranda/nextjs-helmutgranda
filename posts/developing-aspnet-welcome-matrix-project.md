After I got my computer I figured out that WinXP doesnt come with the IIS server to develop for ASP.NET. This is a major problem if you are like me who has to develop in different languages under the same platform. Well, I found this little application called ASP.NET Web Matrix Project. It is only 1.3 MB in file size and some people comment that this little application is better than Visual Studio in all aspects, but most of all its FREE!!! Gratis!!!
