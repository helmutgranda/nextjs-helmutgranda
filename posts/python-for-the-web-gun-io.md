> This article will give an extremely high level overview of how to use **python for the web**. There are many ways you can interact with the web using python, and this post will cover all of them. This includes python web scraping, interacting with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and running your own python web site using python server software. There are many ways to do all these things in python, but I'm going to show you how to do it the _right_ way using the most modern techniques.

Great article to get an overview of Python for the web. I wish more articles were written like this or maybe we all should be inspired by this article to write more like it.
