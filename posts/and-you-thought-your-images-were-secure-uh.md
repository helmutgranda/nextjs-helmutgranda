Despite what anybody tells you - it it IMPOSSIBLE to stop people viewing your code or copying your pictures

To save you looking any further - it can't be done. But if you want to know the reasons why, and you want to try 'something' to make it just a little more difficult for people to steal your stuff, please read futher on this site

And by the way, don't bother telling me that there are a number of other ways to defeat the scripts and tricks here - I already know that. Don't bother telling me that browser X allows you to view sources without trouble - I already know that. The whole point of this web site is to reinforce the idea that you can't stop it, so you might as well get used to the idea.
