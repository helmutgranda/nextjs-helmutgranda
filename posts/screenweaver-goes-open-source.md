From Ryko:

> After I had a little chat with Darron Schall a few days back, I've been working on bringing the Screenweaver 3 code base up to date: I've decided to release it open source.
> 
> Under the same licence (GNU GPL) I will also release a new development effort called Screenweaver Core. Read more about it here.
> 
> I'll need about one or two weeks to get everything organized properly, after which both projects will be available through OSFlash.
