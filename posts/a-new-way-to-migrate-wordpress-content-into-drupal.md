> Initially, we intended to do this using the [WordPress Import](http://drupal.org/project/wordpress_import) module. However WordPress Import is a stand-alone module that does not integrate with CCK fields, meaning that you cannot import WordPress post categories or authors as CCK text or node-reference fields. It also has limited options for importing files attached to WordPress posts.
