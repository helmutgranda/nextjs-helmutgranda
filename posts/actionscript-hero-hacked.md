I just read in ASH's website that his [AS Defenitive List was hacked](http://www.actionscripthero.com/blog/archives/2004_12.php). I do not understand how some one would just harm a site that does nothing but help the community.

I am glad to read that ASH is getting his [AS Defenitive List Reloaded.](http://www.actionscripthero.com/blog/archives/000374.php)
