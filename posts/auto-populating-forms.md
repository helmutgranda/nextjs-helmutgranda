I received an email fro Adobe and after following the link provided I was welcomed with a pre-populated form (as the one below)

 

 

At this point I would press submit and download the marketing material, after taking a closer look I noticed the "Show/hide pre-populated information" link.

I personally do not like pre-populated forms, I believe that if the form is going to try to fetch my information at that point that can be a tracking even on the database even if I do not download the information offered.
