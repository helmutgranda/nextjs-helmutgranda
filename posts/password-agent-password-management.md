Are you tired of having to remember every password there is?

Are you tired of having to go over notes to find that password you know you wrote down somewhere?

Well, do not worry you can use Password Agent:

**Description:** Password Agent is a password manager program that allows you to store all your passwords, secret notes and data snippets in a single, easy to navigate, and secure database. Too many passwords to remember? Pieces of paper that you once used to write down your important account information are lost? Want to find required password quickly? Password Agent keeps track all of your different passwords - no problems, no worries. And, it keeps strangers away from accessing your private information. ------------

There are 2 versions. The Free Version for personal use and the Paid Registered Version.

The Free ("lite") Version has only 1 limitation. You can only save 25 entries per file. In plain english that means that you can only save 25 Passwords per file. Not bad at all, you can organize your passwords per file and you have a very good Password Management tool.
