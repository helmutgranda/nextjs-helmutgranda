I have been using flash for a while but mostly animation and some Icons creation, So I decided to create my own FLASH CHALLENGE. Simple Useless (not always) projects.

At the same time they will help me to refresh my memory on stuff I might have forgotten or that is there but its sitting in the dust.

This will be kind of the continuation of FlashBits Section. All scripting will be done in FLASHMX2004 y with AS2. Its time to catch up with technology.

In the end I hope some one benefits from this.
