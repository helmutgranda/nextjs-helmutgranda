Having the ability to fold blocks of code in TextMate can be a great time saver. Specially if you are working on a rather large file and you are trying to concentrate only in one area of your code.

You can activate block folding by pressing F1 and this is how the content is going to look like:

One of my desires is to find out how to jump through blocks of code rather than using the arrow keys to navigate through them.
