I had a good day today at work, I still have tons to do at home.

Some how it just feels good to know that a day was productive.

Anyways, I found the other day a good book store on line, It is called [BookPool](http://www.bookpool.com) I found that prices are cheaper than in [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com).

The search engine it is ok. Amazon has a better navigation sistem and localization of items. Also you can view more pictures in Amazon. But if you are into saving money BookPool is your choice
