Accordingly to TechCrunch YouTube will stop surpport for IE6.

> "Judging by this screenshot taken by an IE6 user who was watching some videos on [YouTube![](images/t.gif)](http://youtube.com/), it appears the Google company will be phasing out support for the browser shortly. I donâ€™t have Internet Explorer 6 installed on my computer, so I canâ€™t verify this first hand, but illogical it seems not and a simple [Twitter search![](images/t.gif)](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=youtube+ie6) shows multiple people confirming the news. Heck, some are even [downright ecstatic![](images/t.gif)](http://twitter.com/GamerJunkdotNet/statuses/2590419459) over the news."

For many developers it has been a nightmare to apply hacks to their code to make design fit IE6 standards and this move might help other big players help users upgrade their browsers and make the web a "better" place. With YouTube encouraging users to install other browsers such as Google Chrome or FireFox we can only hope that people understand that Internet Explorer is just a piece of software that that there are other alternatives for online browsing that give you a better experience.
