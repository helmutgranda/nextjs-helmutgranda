I have been working with PHP/mySQL development for the past few weeks and I haven't been asked to work on Flash ActionScript Development for a while. During the week I started to develop a simple Drop down menu. Just like any other time I sketched the drop down and wrote down how I wanted the drop down to behave.

All of the sudden I went blank when I started to write the functions and passing variables all over the movie. Not only that but I started to sweat when I realized that the scripting had to be done in AS1 instead of AS2. No that it is more difficult or anything but for some reason I just panicked.

Luckily all my memories came back soon but I was amazed at how easily you can panic when you can't remember something. I don't know if this has happened to any of you but if it has my most sincere sympathy :)
