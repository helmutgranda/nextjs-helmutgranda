Glad to see the team from Adobe pushing hard to make Flash the tool of choice for all the environment, from Mobile to HTML. The video below displays the capabilities of Flash to be able to export to animation with just HTML, not only that but you will have the ability to re-use the HTML code already generated.

I would like to know how this tool will behave with non-timeline animation (I hope they are working on coded-animation conversion) and how heavy the HTML pages converted will be. Either way props to Adobe for moving forward on this Flash to HTML conversion tool.
