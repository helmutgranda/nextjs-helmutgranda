For some reason [AOL](http://www.aol.com) is not giving news about the war as they used to the last days. I wonder if they do that just to calm people. but anyhow, [CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com) still talking about it as before.

In anoter case, i heard that [BBC](http://www.bb.com) is talking about the war also, i havent been able to check it, I heard it is a british company. but to tell you the truth you can check it out at your own risk.
