Finally after a while we are moving along. Christ the King Baptist Church that is. I designed that page a few years back, we are ready for a change ! yeah!.

To start we switched from a free server to this server in humanletter.com. No more pop-ups for that site. One time as my pastor's wife and I were going over the site. A casino add came up!! can you believe it? that is when I said. no more. so we finally got it switched, not only that but the Guestboard is going away too. that one has adds that have nothing to do with the church.

Get ready for new things soon!
