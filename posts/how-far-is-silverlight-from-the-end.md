It is not certain how long Silverlight will continue to be the main platform for some developers but after the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference (PDC) this week it seems like its life is coming close to and end, in regards to web applications. ZDNET had the chance to talk to Bob Muglia, the Microsoft President in charge of the company's server and tools business about Silverlight and this is what he commented.

> “Silverlight is our development platform for Windows Phone,” he said. Silverlight also has some “sweet spots” in media and line-of-business applications, he said.
> 
> But when it comes to touting Silverlight as Microsoft’s vehicle for delivering a cross-platform runtime, “our strategy has shifted,” Muglia told me.
> 
> Silverlight will continue to be a cross-platform solution, working on a variety of operating system/browser platforms, going forward, he said. “But HTML is the only true cross platform solution for everything, including (Apple’s) iOS platform,” Muglia said.

It is clear that for the web Microsoft will take the HTML5 route and leave Silveright for their mobile devices. As this will be a strong sell point for those who stick with Silveright in the mobile devices maybe it is time to start learning (or continue learning) a different language or platform.
