It takes a while for people to adapt to change and many resist to change due to the adaptation and complexity in integrating these changes may bring to our workflow, [ClojureWerkz](http://blog.clojurewerkz.org/blog/2013/09/07/how-to-write-a-useful-change-log/) team posted three questions you should ask when writing a change log:

> A useful project change log answers three questions:
> 
> > Whether it is critical to update
> > 
> > Whether the release is backwards compatible
> > 
> > What has changed and why
> 
> A change log that covers these three points will help your users adopt new versions faster, even in some of the most conservative corporate environments. It will also make the ops people respect your project more.
