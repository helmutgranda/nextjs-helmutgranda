If you are exporting any artwork from Illustrator to SWF and when working in Flash and player 7(or less) you might get the following error "Enhanced stroke is not supported in this player".  
  
One way to fix this issue is by setting "Perserve Editability Where Possible" under the Method section.  
Now this might not work with all the artwork where you want to be able to do heavy edits within flash but its worth a shoot.
