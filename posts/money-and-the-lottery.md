I just came back from the gast station.

I went to get a phone card to make a long distance phone call. So i stand there in line for about 5 minutes (I was second in line). I normally just concentrate in that I am going to pay and forget what is going on around me. After waiting for about 5 minutes i tool a quick look at what she was doing, then I realized she was running lottery tickets through their machine. Another 5 minutes went by and she was still running tickets from the person that was in front of me. I was amazed of how much some one could spend in lottery tickets. So i thought to myself "This person must have spend at least 30 dollars in this tickets!" I could not believe it.

After she finished running all the tickets she is ready to charge me. But the person in front of me goes "Now I want 80 dollars of ..... wait I am not in a hurry you can charge the people that are behind me" by this time there was at least 10 people before me. Can you believe it? This person was going to buy another 80 dollars worth of Lottery Tickets! the 80 dollars were in an evelope where it seemed like 1, 5 and 10 dollar bills.

I just dont understand some people. I cant imagine what this person could have done with 80 dollars insted of spending them in lottery tickets
