Time is going faster and faster in our lives,

Every second that passes by is one second less in our lives... how do we know we have made the right decitions?

How do we know we are heading the right direction?

Are we wasting our lives?

I just heard a speaker on the radio say something like

"maybe this is your last chance"

that is so true, none of us know for sure if we will be alive in the next 5 minutes. But what it is worse is knowing that, and no doing anything about it.
