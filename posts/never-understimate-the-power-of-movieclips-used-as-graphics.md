When the time comes when you have to develop the same set of animations for different sets and different sizes donâ€™t forget to use your MovieClips as Graphics, this is a great way to save work for everyone.

Not only you will be able to deliver on time (and if you are lucky under schedule) but also you will be able to produce work faster and at the same time cut prices for the production. So in the end this is a Win-Win situation
