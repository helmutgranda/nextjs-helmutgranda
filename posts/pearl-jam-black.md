Sheets of empty canvas untouched sheets of clay Laid spread out before me as her body once did

All five horizons revolved around her soul as the Earth to the Sun Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken turns

Oooh.. And all I told her was ... everything I know she gave me all that she wore And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything All the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything...

Oh... I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by some kids at play I can feel their laughter So, why do I sear?

Oh, I'm twisting thoughts that spin round my head I'm spinning ... I'm spinning How quick the sun can drop away... And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything All the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything All the love gone bad turned my world to black tattooed all I see... all that I am... all I'll be....

I know some day you'll have a beautiful life I know you'll be a sun In somebody else's sky but why ... why... why... can't it be... can't it be mine...

We... We belong... We belong together together... We... We belong... We belong together... oh yeah...
