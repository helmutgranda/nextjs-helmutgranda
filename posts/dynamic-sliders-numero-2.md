Title: Dynamic Sliders Numero 2

After working with the previous version of the sliders -se previous post-. I had the opportunity to "upgrade" the sliders since there was a slight chance that the sliders had to react to only one button rather than two as originally planned. Needless to say it wasn't required to apply this update but it came out nice. Once again there was no need to update anything in the class but just 2 extra lines of code.
