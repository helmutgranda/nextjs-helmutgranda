Sometimes is difficult to integrate the GTD system into your everyday life tools, locally for us Jeffrey C. Long posted the setup he uses in Ical, as most of you know Ical is only available for MAC and there is no sight of being developed for PC. There are similar items like Mozillas Calendar that for what I understand the Mozilla's Calendar can be sincronized with Ical.

So see for yourself and check the Set up that Jeffrey posted in Google Groups:
