If you are like me that has lots of passwords to remember, I recommend the program Password Agent,

From Password Agent Website: Password Agent is a password manager program that allows you to store all your passwords, secret notes and data snippets in a single, easy to navigate, and secure database. Too many passwords to remember? Pieces of paper that you once used to write down your important account information are lost? Want to find required password quickly? Password Agent keeps track all of your different passwords - no problems, no worries. And, it keeps strangers away from accessing your private information.

Now, you can get the paid version or you can get the Lite version, which is the one that i have hehe ;o).
