> ## So What’s Springboard Then?
> 
> [**Springboard**](http://blog.soulwire.co.uk//goto/https://github.com/soulwire/Springboard) is an _ultra minimal_ JavaScript / CSS and HTML project template (or _springboard_).
> 
> It features a very useful [ANT](http://blog.soulwire.co.uk//goto/http://ant.apache.org/) build file which, among other things, can:
> 
> - Refactor template files to match your project’s namespace so you’re ready to code in seconds
> - Combine JavaScript and CSS libraries to reduce HTTP requests
> - Compile JavaScript using the [Google Closure Compiler](http://blog.soulwire.co.uk//goto/http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/) _(simple or advanced)_
> - Minify CSS using the [YUI Compressor](http://blog.soulwire.co.uk//goto/http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/)
> - Generate JavaScript documentation using the [JSDoc Toolkit](http://blog.soulwire.co.uk//goto/http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/)
> - Sanitize HTML and inject variables at compile time
> 
> Also included is a simple JavaScript **Model-View-Controller** (MVC) template (based on [Alex Netkachov’s](http://blog.soulwire.co.uk//goto/http://www.alexatnet.com/content/model-view-controller-mvc-javascript)) which can optionally be used as a basis for your project.

> Hopefully No fluff – just the very basics you need to get a project or experiment started.
