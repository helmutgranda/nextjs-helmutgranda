"Harlem-13-Gigapixels.com, the largest known stitched panorama, is a colaboration between artist Gerard Maynard and Kolor Company, represented by Alexandre Jenny."

One neat thing about the site is that it always leaves you wanting more, not in the sense that the site is unfinished or that the pictures are low quality but the idea that everytime you zoom or pan you find new little items to explore.
