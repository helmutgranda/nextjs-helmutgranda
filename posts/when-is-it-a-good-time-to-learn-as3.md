I see this question pop once in a while in different places in the internet or similar questions such as...

Should I start learning AS3 yet? Is it worth it to make the switch from AS2 to AS3? I have never used flash, should I start with AS3 or learn AS2 and then AS3?

I am surprised that these kind of questions still come up and once and for all I want to give you an answer. YES!

Why yes? well for starters _if you mean to stay in the interactive world of the internet you need to start_ Today. Not tomorrow... or next week... or with the next project, start learning AS3 today.

Once you understand the way you program in AS3 it not only will make sense to you but other similar languages will also make sense. Imagine the possibilities on that.

You will be able to improve on your coding skills and make better reusable software, given that you are paying attention on what you are doing and not just copy-and-paste type of coding.

"But I am a designer not a coder" Great! Then talk to your boss and explain him/her that you don't want to code and the earlier you admit that you want to dedicate your life at designing rather than coding the better it will be for everyone. Hopefully your boss will understand and find the perfect match to your design skills.
