> A test user is a user account associated with an app created for the purpose of testing the functionality of that application. You can use test users for manual or automated testing.
> 
> We allow you to access the test account via a login\_url which allows you to directly login to the account. The login\_url expires after one hour, but you easily refresh it to get a new login\_url for the same test user. We also provide you an access\_token for the test user so that you can take actions on behalf of the test user via the api.
> 
> An application can create up to 500 test users to start testing an application.
> 
> Currently one can only create and manage test user accounts via the API described below but in the near future we will be providing access to this via the developer app.
