As the Year 2004 begings. We all start with new objectives in our lives. We can be certain of one thing, _"We can not change our past, but we can change our future"_.

We certainly can not make our past any different. Where ever we messed up it is over, we can not fix that or come back in time and make anything different. But what we do and how we behave with the concecuences it is just up to us.

I hope that this year 2004 it is full of riches and blessings from God, and that He help us to accomplish those things we have set in our hearts.

Have an awesome year everyone!!!!
