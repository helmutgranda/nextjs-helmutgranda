So I was working on a project where we needed some sliders, it was basically the same slider but in different sizes and positions. So today I was sitting there just wondering how I could make this more dynamic, and just put a small class together and created a small sample. Updating the sliders the way they were originally created took a long time but allowing the sliders take the parameters dynamically it took seconds to update.

Here is the sample and feel free to play with it :)
