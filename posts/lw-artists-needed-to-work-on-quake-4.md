Raven is looking to hire:

2D/3D Texture and World Model Artist Position for Quake 4:

Raven is looking for a 2-D/3-D artist to concept, build, and paint complex textures and world models for Quake 4. We prefer an artist with experience working in the PC gaming industry, with an understanding of creating textures and world models, but with very strong drawing, concepting, and painting skills. A more realistic artistic style is preferred. An ability to create game art for different genres - such as Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and Horror - is a definite plus, but a strong background in drawing and painting sci-fi is a must for Quake 4. The position will also require an understanding of 3-D hi-poly and low-poly model building in Lightwave or Maya.

We will require a resume and samples of your texture and world models on disc or on a viewable online site. Examples of your modeling prowess is needed, too. Send all resumes and samples to Kevin Long at [klong@ravensoft.](mailto:klong@ravensoft.com) or mail them to:

Raven Software c/o Kevin Long Three Point Place - Suite One Madison, WI 53719
