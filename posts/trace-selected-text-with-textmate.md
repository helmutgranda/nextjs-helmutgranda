That is right, thanks to the guys from TextMate and their help I was able to get a small Macro that will trace the selected word in Flash.

What I mean is this:

1\. Select a word 2. Run the Macro 3. the word you selected will appear in the next line as follows:

trace("the Word You Selected = " + the Word You Selected);

Neat uh?

Bind that to a short cut (in my case CMD-E) and anytime you need to trace a variable or an object you are set to go.

Interested in the macro?
