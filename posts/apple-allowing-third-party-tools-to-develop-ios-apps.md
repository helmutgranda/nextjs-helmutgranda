Today Apple has surprised a lot of people by releasing the following news:

"In particular, we are relaxing all restrictions on the development tools used to create iOS apps, as long as the resulting apps do not download any code. This should give developers the flexibility they want, while preserving the security we need."

[Apple 09 statement](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09statement.html)

Will you able to develop apps for their mobile devices from Adobe Applications? I guess time will tell but overall good news for everyone who are developing third party SDKs to allow people develop Applications without having to jump into the Objective-C wagon.

## Update:

"By the way Apple just approved an update to one of my Flash CS5 iPhone Packager based apps that had been in queue since March! It's back on!" Robert Hall Some twitter noice out there already based on the changes:
