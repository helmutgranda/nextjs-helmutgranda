I saw this link posted in FlashCoders.

For those of you who are interested in catching up with AS2 check out [ECMAScript 4 Netscape Proposal](http://www.mozilla.org/js/language/es4/).

If you read through the document, to my understanding you will get a very good grip of what AS2 is all about.

So, what are you waiting for? check out the link and start reading!!
